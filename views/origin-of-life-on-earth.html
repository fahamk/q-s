                                                    <p>Our universe started started from nothing around 13.72 Billions years ago, with the same laws as prevalent today and with the time and space as fabric of the space. It has four dimension i.e. time, space right/left, up/down, fore/back. Our universe have energy in in active form and in form of matter which is frozen energy. In addition, our universe have fundamental forces and natural laws that dictate the interaction rules of fundamental forces. The laws of nature that have in its grip each single atom of the universe, never change, never deviate. Even the results of human free-will are controlled by laws given in Quran. Law of evolution is a special law in nature that handless event happening in the universe towards a particular direction step by step. (Al Ma'arij).</p>

                                                    <p>In the whole universe, every thing is conserved. Force of nature can be converted from one form to an other (malaika handover) but can never be destroyed. In the transforming process, the forces do wonders in nature or as the man dictates them to do. Similar, in the whole universe not a single iota of energy (pure energy + energy frozen in the form of matter)  can be destroyed or injected.</p>

                                                    <p>The universe laws are written in mathematical codes, a hidden text written at some safe place, which under lie every thing. To discover the origin on naturals laws is not in the scope of science.  Some scientist believe the natural laws are written at platonic world. (LOHE MAHFOOZ in UNIVERSE AMR)</p>

                                                    <p>Science reveal there is coherent scheme of every thing. Universe is integrated and acts like a giant computer. In the world below atomic level, the science rules are different. Time lose its significance. Future may shape past. Human awareness change the nature of event. Human mind speak to matter. The things move so fast that a second of time is like hundred of years. The time, which is fabric of space membrane in our universe, is as measured from different places or at different speed. At speed of light, the time stops. At the event horizon of a black-hole star (al kunnas) the time stops.</p>

                                                    <p>There are around 3 billion stars in a galaxy, and around 4 billions observable galaxies are in the universe. It is expected to be 300 billion light years across.  Universe space is stretching with acceleration as the time pass</p>

                                                    <p>The above universe, with its laws and forces, created its own conscious intelligent observer within short time of 13.7 billion years. The universe is bound by start time and end time.</p>

                                                    <p>Human are at a small planet revolving around an isolated star. Human is made of dust particles are structured in a way that they make the only intelligent observer to the vast universe who can also glimpse the cosmic code.</p>

                                                    <p>The question is how did non living material develop the hardware and software known to be required by living organisms?  How did nature develop the arbitrary protocol for communication and coordination among the thousands of computer worth information in each cell? We shall find the definite answers to the above questions below on this page.</p>

                                                    <p><strong>General summary of the story of life as per science</strong></p>

                                                    <p>The earth was constructed around 5 Billion years ago in the whirlpool of solar system in the making. Initially earth was too hot and there was no water on it.  Meteorites from the outer belt, having crystals of frozen water, started falling on earth for about 15 million years, until the earth got water as available now. This quantity of water is necessary to keep the earth temperature uniform for life to prosper. There was air but without oxygen.  Around 4.5 billion years ago moon was formed when another planet collided with the earth leaving its iron on earth and debris recollection again in the form of moon at a distance around 14000 km away around the earth. The moon gradually moved away at present location. Around 4.1 billion years ago the earth crust started building. When the crust was sufficiently cold, the water, which was in vapor form, started condensing into liquid form.</p>

                                                    <p>It took earth about one billion years to take shape with solid outer crust and oceans to appear. Earth crust is made of land plates that float over hot liquid iron located in between central solid iron core and outer earth. The land plates keep on moving with speed of millimeters per year. When two plates collide, it create upheaval in the form of earth quacks, hot lava shoot outs, tsunamis and formation of mountains.</p>

                                                    <p>3.7 Billion years ago in marshy landscape, within the soup of hot water and enriched clay, life emerged in the form of single cell of DNA. Life cell have qualities to replicate itself and gradually adapts to the factors of environment. Adaptation is special programming linked with life.  Initially the life cell was without outer membrane.</p>

                                                    <p>We can still see the rudimentary single cell form of life in term of viruses, bacteria and fungus cells. Ameba cell is a perfect example as we are taught in schools with contemporary knowledge.  The food of initial life cells was sulphur compounds and oxygen was the output and not the the input.</p>

                                                    <p>In the first one billion years the life progressed and produced oxygen in the environment. The life evolved so that it absorbed oxygen and used sunlight to produce food. At this stage, there was hardly anything to differentiate life into plants and animals.</p>

                                                    <p>About one billion years ago, the life started as multi cellular. Each area specialized into doing a special function. Even today, each cell contains the prints of full body. For further details, please refer the time line of the life given below.</p>

                                                    <ol class="number-lists" start="3">
                                                    	<li>The electromagnetic force is 39 orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force. If they were more comparable in strength, stars would have collapsed long before life had a chance to evolve.</li>

                                                        <li>The vacuum energy density of the universe is at least 120 orders of magnitude lower than some theoretical estimates. If at any time it were as large as these calculations suggest, the universe would have quickly blown apart.</li>

                                                        <li>The electron's mass is less than the difference in the masses of the neutron and proton. Thus, a free neutron can decay into a proton, electron, and anti-neutrino. If this were not the case, the neutron would be stable and most of the protons and electrons in the early universe would have combined to form neutrons, leaving little hydrogen to act as the main component and fuel of stars.</li>

                                                        <li>The neutron is heavier than the proton, but not so much heavier that neutrons cannot be bound in nuclei, where conservation of energy prevents the neutrons from decaying. Without neutrons we would not have the heavier elements needed for building complex systems such as life.</li>

                                                        <li>The carbon nucleus has an excited energy level at around 7.65 million electron-volts (MeV). Without this state, insufficient carbon would be manufactured in stars to form the basis for life. Using Anthropic arguments, astronomer Fred Hoyle predicted this energy level before it was confirmed experimentally.</li>

                                                        <li><strong>Gravitational constant:</strong> Determines strength of gravity. If lower than stars would have insufficient pressure to overcome Coulomb barrier to start thermonuclear fusion (i.e. stars would not shine). If higher, stars burn too fast, use up fuel before life has a chance to evolve.</li>

                                                        <li><strong>Strong force coupling constant:</strong> Holds particles together in nucleus of atom. If weaker than multi-proton particles would not hold together, hydrogen would be the only element in the Universe. If stronger, all elements lighter than iron would be rare. Also radioactive decay would be less, which heats core of Earth.</li>

                                                        <li><strong>Electromagnetic coupling constant:</strong> Determines strength of electromagnetic force that couples electrons to nucleus. If less, than no electrons held in orbit. If stronger, electrons will not bond with other atoms. Either way, no molecules.</li>

                                                        <li>All the above constants are critical to the formation of the basic building blocks of life. And, the range of possible values for these constants is very narrow, only about 1 to 5% for the combination of constants. Outside this range, and life (in particular, intelligent life) would be impossible</li>

If ice sank when it formed, more and more ocean water would freeze to ice so that the polar seas and beyond would be a solid block of ice.<br><br>(2) Even the planets either side of Earth have conditions unsuitable for life.<br><br>(3) All these unique characteristics of Earth point to an intelligent designer, not to evolution.<br><br>(4) Evolutionists have countered this argument by hypothesizing that the universe is full of planets, and Earth just happened to have the correct formula for life, by chance.<br><br>"They said there are countless other planets unlike Earth, and Earth happened by chance to have the properties necessary for life.

                                                    <p>The great contemporary scientist <strong>Steve Hawking</strong>, in his book The Grand Design, chapter Apparent Miracle writes that:<br>"For us to exist, the universe must contain elements such as carbon, which are produced by cooking lighter elements inside stars. The carbon must then be scattered through space in a supernova explosion (explosion of massive star 100 time bigger than our sun), and eventual condense as part of a planet in a new generation solar system (such as ours). In 1961, physicist Robert Dicke argued that the process takes about 10 billion years, so our being here means that the universe must be at least that old. On the other hand, the universe cannot be much older than 10 billion years, since in the far future all the fuel for stars will have been used up, and we require hot stars for our sustenance. Hence the universe must be about 10 billion year old. That is not extremely precise prediction but that is true – according to current data the big bang occurred about 13.7 billion years ago."</p>

                                                    <p>Elements formation to create of Adam started 10 billion years ago. The universe was just about 4 billion years old and there was nothing much except light elements such as hydrogen, and helium.  First generation of large gaseous stars appeared. Each star shines with nuclear fusion and act like a time bomb. Bigger the star, quickly it burn its fuel and shorter is its life. At the end, the star explode in the form of great fire work of the nature in the sky. The event of great explosion is called supernova.  Our sun is one of the smallest stars and has 10 billion year life. Very large star last for around two to five billion years.</p>

                                                    <p><strong>تُمْ أَشَدُّ خَلْقًا أَمِ السَّمَهَا ﴿٧ رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا ﴿٨</strong><br>79/27: Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He made it.<br>79/28: Allah created these huge bodies high up in space. He then gave them balance and equilibrium so that they would remain stable and continue on their path.</p>

                                                    <p>When Generation 1 star started exploding, they cooked and spread elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen into clouds of dust and gas. Such clouds in the galaxy, rich of the exploded star contents, breed new solar and planet systems.</p>

                                                    <p>(About 8 billion years ago) Generation 2 stars were made. Some of these were as big in volume as 1000 suns. The main purpose to make giant stars was to produce all other heavy elements necessary to make ADAM. Giant stars are cooking factories of heavy elements like iron, copper, zinc, silver, gold, platinum, mercury, uranium etc. When such a giant star explode, energy produced is like billions of suns. Elements shoot out with the very high speed  into the open space to make planetary nebula. Powerful gamma radiation shooting out form south and north pole, near to the speed of light, push clouds of planetary nebula . Such a shoot-out initiates a new solar and planet system. (Please refer solar system formation on this website)</p>

                                                    <p>Such a giant star exploded as supernova, to shoot out newly cooked all of the elements that were necessary to make earth. Shoot out from newly exploded star initiated a new solar system. Whirlpool of gases and elementary atoms with sun at centre reached at a critical mass, Hydrogen inside the centre of the whirlpool, under heavy pressure of gravity became too hot and ignited to form Helium. The light of our sun appeared. The heat of sun pushed gases circulating in whirlpool, away to form Jupiter and other gas planets. Heavy elements remained at inner circle of whirlpool to form 200 small earths. Many earths merged into one another and a few were left at the end. Earths made in the cold outer circle between earth and Jupiter, were full of water in ice form. With the help of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, water full planets, made in asteroid belt,  were thrown towards Earth, Mars Venus and Mercury. Our earth was one of the remaining planets at green zone distance from our sun, which is appropriate retain water in liquid condition and to support life. Later, an other small planet  hit our earth, left its iron at our earth and slipped out with remaining matter to form as our moon. So our moon has little iron at its core.</p>

                                                    <p>DNA contains the instructions needed for an organism to develop, survive and reproduce. To carry out these functions, DNA sequences must be converted into messages that can be used to produce proteins, which are the complex molecules that do most of the work in our bodies.</p>

                                                    <p>An important property of DNA is that it can replicate, or make copies of itself. Each strand of DNA in the double helix can serve as a pattern for duplicating the sequence of bases. This is critical when cells divide because each new cell needs to have an exact copy of the DNA present in the old cell.</p>

                                                    <p><img src="assets/images/dna.jpg"></p>

                                                    <p>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule which contains the biological instructions that make each species unique. DNA, along with the instructions it contains, is passed from adult organisms to their offspring during reproduction.</p>

                                                    <p>DNA is found inside a special area of the cell called the nucleus. Because the cell is very small, and because organisms have many DNA molecules per cell, each DNA molecule must be tightly packaged. This packaged form of the DNA is called a chromosome.</p>

                                                    <p>During DNA replication, DNA unwinds so it can be copied. At other times in the cell cycle, DNA also unwinds so that its instructions can be used to make proteins for other biological processes. But during cell division, DNA is in its compact chromosome form which enables it to transfer to new replicate cells.</p>

                                                    <p>Besides the DNA located in the nucleus, humans and other complex organisms also have a small amount of DNA in cell structures known as mitochondria. Mitochondria generate the energy the cell needs to function properly.</p>

                                                    <p>In sexual reproduction, organisms inherit half of their nuclear DNA from the male parent and half from the female parent. However, organisms inherit all of their mitochondrial DNA from the female parent. This occurs because only egg cells, and not sperm cells, keep their mitochondria during fertilization.</p>

Consciousness or free-will in the brain cells, is so far not addressed by science. It maybe because, so far, consciousness is not known as some thing physical in nature.</p>

It is because the Earth is most suitable for existence of life.</p>

                                                    <p>So far human did not find life originated other than the first event 3.7 billions years ago.</p>

                                                    <p>3.7 Billion years ago in marshy landscape, within the soup of hot water and enriched clay, life emerged in the form of single cell of DNA. Existence of life is considered the proof of the origin of life. Life cell have qualities to replicate itself together with information software and ability to adapt gradually to the factors of environment. Adaptation is special programming linked with life.  Initially the life cell was without outer membrane, which is still found in nature in the form of virus.</p>

                                                    <p>We can still see the rudimentary single cell form of life in term of viruses, bacteria and fungus cells. Ameba cell is a perfect example as we are taught in schools with contemporary knowledge.  The food of initial life cells was sulphur compounds and oxygen was the output and not the the input.</p>

                                                    <p>In the first one billion years the life progressed and produced oxygen in the environment. The life evolved so that it absorbed oxygen and used sunlight to produce food. At this stage, there was hardly anything to differentiate life into plants and animals.</p>

                                                    <p>About one billion years ago, the life started as multi cellular. Each area specialized into doing a special function. Even today, each cell contains the prints of full body. For further details, please refer the time line of the life given as appendix on next page.</p>

The duration of these evolutionary stages, according to your count, may be a thousand years;  (70/4 fifty thousand years).</p>

For this purpose He has maintained an excellent balance in the creation of everything; and one of His schemes is the creation of man.   Human's creation was initiated from inorganic matter which before you, was lying lifeless in the form of clay.</p>

God infuses into man a spark of His Divine Energy (which is called human personality' and which gives him ability for discretion and choice). He endows unto you the faculties of hearing and seeing as well as a mind.  Yet only few people use these faculties properly.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>How we can come to life again?:</strong> 32/10.        It is strange that the human beings We created out of lifeless inorganic matter, raise the objection, "How is it possible that after we are dead and lost in the dust, that we will again be restored to a new life?"    In fact the only people who raise these objections are those who do not want to face the Law of Mukafat and want to get away from being accountable for their deeds.</p>

Tell them, "Our heavenly forces under whose control your physical system functions, are taking you gradually towards death; and a day will come when your physical machinery will stop functioning.  But this will only destroy your body.  Your human personality does not perish, for it goes beyond; and its future is determined by the deeds performed by you in this world.</p>

                                                   <p>Evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next. This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments.</p>

                                                   <p>As the life progress, species that adopt to environment and the spices that are more fit to the environment survive better. Species that can not adopt to the environment, eliminate.</p>

                                                   <p>From one life cell, life in all forms spread on earth. Second example of creation of life, so far,  is not found on earth since 4.6 billion years when the earth planet was created. First single cell appeared 3.7 billions years ago.  Multi cellular life started about 1 billion years ago. Initially the multi cellular life split into plants and animals and there after spread into millions of species of plants and animals. There has been many periods of destructions, that kept the evolution of human in focus.</p>

                                                   <p>Around 300,000 years ago, the human appeared in its existing form.  Domestication of plants and animals started around 11 000 years ago.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي خَالِقٌ بَشَرًا مِّن صَلْصَالٍ مِّنْ حَمَإٍ مَّسْنُونٍ ﴿٢٨﴾ فَإِذَا سَوَّيْتُهُ وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِي فَقَعُوا لَهُ سَاجِدِينَ ﴿٢٩﴾ فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَائِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ ﴿٣٠﴾ إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّاجِدِينَ ﴿٣١</strong></p>

                                                   <p>Recall when your Lord said to the controllers: "I will indeed bring into being a human being out of dry ringing clay wrought from black mud. (Having passed through various evolutionary stages [by controllers of the nature], life, manifested itself in the form of human beings) who were endowed with freedom of the will and choice (2/30).. At that stage the Malaika were asked to bow before Man. Thus all of the controllers bowed except for Satan  who chose to be defiant</p>

                                                   <p>Note: With technological developments, forces of nature, in line with laws of nature (MALAIKA - angles) conform to the human needs.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Scope of human knowledge</strong></p>

                                                   <p><strong>وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا</strong><br>After this he taught Adam the names of all things (in current universe)</p>

                                                   <p>Name is the basic block of knowledge. Human, has been endowed with the capacity to acquire knowledge of how other things function and inter-relate, and how new things can be formed by combining existing elements.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Human given the ability to express his thoughts through power of speech<br>خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ  عَلَّمَهُ الْبَيَانَ</strong><br>55:3-4.      This is from the Almighty Who not only created man but also gave him the ability to express his thoughts (power of speech), which is not available to other species.  (For imparting guidance to mankind, He chose the process of Wahi, whereby one person receives guidance from the Almighty and then conveys it to other human beings.  This mode of communication is confined to man alone.)</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Human given the capability to communicate through writing</strong></p>

To achieve this objective, the Almighty gave man the capability to communicate his ideas to distant places, through writings. This brings human beings closer to one another, despite long distances and differences in time, and paves the way for unity of mankind.</p>

                                                   <p>96/5.         Then (through Wahi) He imparted knowledge that man did not have before.</p>

                                                   <p>96/6-7.      However, man believes that he does not need Wahi and devises his own system based on selfish interests.  In that system, the person who somehow amasses immense wealth, believes that he does not need others and thereby rebels against the concept of universal nourishment of mankind.</p>

                                                   <p>96/8.         However haughty and rebellious he may be, one day he has to come to the system of your Rabb. This is so because there is no other solution to his problems.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Today:</strong> There is a great need to free Muslims mind from the tight shackles of tunnel thinking. There is a need to get rid of situation where people look universe from the position of illiteracy</p>

                                                   <p><strong>One billion years from now:</strong> Possibly ADAM will gain control over many of the GALAXY's solar systems and spread into the sky</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Four billion years later:</strong> Days will be very long, Earth will become very hot. Oceans will start drying.</p>
                                                   <p><strong>Parallel world,</strong> 'Al Akhara' with totally different dimensions will be abode of humanity. (it is a different universe with totally different dimensions. With present mind, we can not grasp it)</p>

                                                   <p><strong>هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن طِينٍ ثُمَّ قَضَىٰ أَجَلًا ۖ وَأَجَلٌ مُّسَمًّى عِندَهُ ۖ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تَمْتَرُونَ</strong></p>

                                                   <p>(6/2) It is He who initiated your creation from inanimate matter and prescribed laws to determine the term of your physical life, and the term of life hereafter which He alone knows of. Yet you doubt His existence.</p>
