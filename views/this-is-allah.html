Natural laws (amr) and  parameters for every thing (qadr) 65/3  originate from God. Laws of nature never change, never deviate 31/43 . Forces of nature [malaika, angles] are made responsible to run the operation of universe 13/2, 11, 65/12 . Total of matter + energy is conserved in the universe. Nothing could be added and nothing could be taken out. Force of nature can not be destroyed. When one kind of force is converted into another kind of force form, it bring changes. For example in sun, strong nuclear force is converted to light & heat waves so that it could reach the earth.  Ref: Universe in 6 aeons</p>

                                                       <p>( Arabic, the original word of God is given as primary source of knowledge)</p>

                                                       <p>هُوَ اللَّـهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ ۖ هُوَ الرَّحْمَـٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ ﴿٢٢﴾ هُوَ اللَّـهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلَامُ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ الْعَزِيزُ الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ ۚ سُبْحَانَ اللَّـهِ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ ﴿٢٣﴾ هُوَ اللَّـهُ الْخَالِقُ الْبَارِئُ الْمُصَوِّرُ ۖ لَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ ۚ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ ﴿٢٤</p>

                                                       <p>59/22.           And why should it not be magnificent? It is the Book of Allah, the Possessor of absolute power and authority.  He has knowledge of the unseen and all that can be perceived.   He provides nourishment for the development of the abilities and potentialities of everything, free of cost.</p>

                                                       <p>59/23.           Yes all this is from Allah, besides Whom no one else enjoys any power or authority.  The entire universe belongs to Him.  Only His law is in force in it; and no one else's.  His powers and knowledge are unlimited.  His Being is most perfect and beyond any defect; and He provides nourishment for the development and completion of one's personality.  He protects everything in the universe from the effects of destructive forces and nothing is outside the umbrella of His guardianship. He has complete control and authority; and He therefore has the power to take His programme to its destined goal.  He has kept everything bound strictly within His Laws so that these may not disperse here and there and disturb the universal system.  There is no one equal to Him; and all greatness belongs to Him.  He is far above the possibility that the power and authority of any one else can be ascribed a share with Him.</p>

                                                       <p>59/24.           Allah is the Creator of everything.  Such is the pattern of His creative activity that He starts the process from its initial stage, then passes it through various evolutionary stages of development so that unnecessary elements wither away, when it finally takes a particular form that distinguishes it from other things.  </p>

                                                       <p>The above are some of the Divine attributes.  All these attributes, in their most proportionate, perfect and highest form, are concentrated in His Being.  Such is His system that everything in the heavens and on earth, is busily fulfilling His designated programme.  He alone is the possessor of all might; and His might is based on absolute wisdom.</p>

                                                       <p>اللَّـهُ لَا إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ۚ لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ ۚ لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ ۚ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ ۖ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ ۚ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</p>

The entire universe is engaged in fulfilling His Plan. Who is there who can intercede with Him unless it be in accordance with His Laws. Allah knows the past and present of all people and no one can partake of his knowledge except through the method prescribed by Him. Allah's Authority encompasses the entire universe which He maintains untiringly. His Power extends from the lowest to the highest level of His Creation</p>

                                                       <p>The Universe is being run through the forces of nature which are governed by the rules which we call the natural laws. Not a single particles in the universe is out of discipline. Each force is obeying wish of Allah with absolute perfection.  All forces of nature are directed in a way that they created a conscious observer in the form of The Adam. It is called Anthropic Cosmological Principle in science. The created observer is observing the universe in the live form, from the origin of time till present time.</p>

                                                       <p>The Anthropic principle elaborates that there are at least 40 key points in the making of matter and energy and many other points on earth including earth and moon construction, nature and placement of earth at a distance from sun, origin of water on earth.  If we miss one count or deviate any count  more than a narrow limit,  there is no earth or life on earth as we know.</p>

                                                       <p>At certain points we find that these events does not appear to occur through the existing natural laws in the universe. They appear to occur from  a special source of the natural laws which Quran mention as AMR. Following are occasions which we observe as Allah's special law at work.</p>

                                                       <p>Human cannot know the occasions where Allah's  special order (masahaiet) or regular orders (natural laws of this world - KHALQ)  are in action.   وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</p>

                                                           <p>By obeying these Laws, the human personality is broadened . Whatever is done keeping in mind ones own interest as well as the interest of others, helps to develop ones personality, whereas whatever is done simply for one's own interest retards its development.</p>

                                                           <h3 class="content-heading">God has no son</h3>

                                                           <p>23/91 Allah has not begotten any offspring .  There has never been a deity besides Him .  Tell them that had it been so, each god would surely have stood apart from the others.  Along with their creations they would surely have tried to overrun one another.  Anyway Allah is far above, and free of, whatever concept they have about such gods.</p>

                                                           <p>9/31 They have taken their rabbis and their priests as lords instead of God, as well as the Messiah son of Mary. Although they were commanded to worship none but The One God. There is no god except He. Glory be to Him; High above what they associate with Him</p>

                                                           <h3 class="content-heading">Big clash if there are two Gods</h3>

                                                           <p>21/22.        If there had been a sovereign other than Allah  the entire system of the universe would have run into chaos.  Allah, Who is the Supreme Authority, has kept in His own hands the central control of the universal sustainer.  He is far above what human beings may devise about Him in their own minds</p>
