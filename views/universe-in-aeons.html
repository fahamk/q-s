Now it is expanding with a power balance extremely fine tuned. Also please note that space expansion is uniform from every where and not just at edges. The space expansion is not limited by the speed of light because it is not a matter particle.</p>

                                                    <p>Space of this world is like a membrane made of continuum of space-time. Opposite of the space is nothingness. Space membrane provides an infrastructure where matter and energy can exist.<br>Matter is made of energy. Matter is like a frozen energy strings. Energy either makes the matter or changes the matter.</p>

                                                    <p>Matter can move in three ways; in space, in time or partially to both in time and in space. It is same as going towards North or East. If you go North side you do not go East. If you go East side, you do not go North. If you go in-between, you can go North East.</p>

                                                    <p>When photon moves with the speed of light, it moves in space. It does not move in time. So time is zero for Photon.</p>

                                                    <p>If a person is sitting at one place, the person is not moving in space. The person is only moving in the river of time. Time arrow is one way forward only. River of time is like in liquid form in the future that a person can change. As so soon as the time enters in past, the time river freezes. Now no one can change frozen river of time.  (If time arrow change, we can see each second of our past frozen in time. (It will be discussed in length in a separate chapter of Parallel worlds or YOUM UL AKHARA)</p>

                                                    <p>Increase in gravity slows the time. Gravity creates weight. Gravity is pull of large body upon small body. Or inversely, push of curved space upon small body towards greater curve of large body like earth or sun. If a person is on earth or a clock is sent to sun, the time slows down then normal. At black-hole, where the space is highly curved, the time is so slow that everything thing look frozen to human eye at the event horizon of a black-hole.</p>

                                                    <p>Our Earth also creates a little curvature in the space, so, GPS satellites, at 26,600 KM from the centre of the earth; the time clocks are faster than the clocks on earth, and need hourly time adjustment with the clocks placed on earth.</p>

                                                    <p>'M' THEORY: Latest science theory is string theory which considers space as membrane. Scientific equations of string theory point out seven dimensions in addition to four dimensions of our universe i.e. left-right, up-down, fore-back and time. Similarly, out of four fundamental forces, gravity is the weakest and its string is loop shaped that can go into parallel membrane or parallel world. The parallel world  could be centimetres away from us.  As of now, scientist assume that force of gravity is weak because it bulge into the parallel world.</p>

                                                    <p>Space was created and expanded and is still expanding with the increased speed as the time pass . On the other hand, clusters of galaxies are not disintegrating (due to dark matter). We shall never see those galactic structures that are running away from us possibly with more than the speed of light due to expansion of space itself.</p>

                                                    <p>After the space was built, matter appeared in that space in the form of white hot smoke like plasma of the size of a solar system in a Nano second. Also within billionth of a second, all fundamental forces (MALAYAKA) appeared.</p>

                                                    <p>Balance in cosmos, between matter attractive gravity vs. matter repulsive force (dark energy)  is such that cosmos is expanding with more speed as the time passes.</p>

                                                    <p>If both are equal and the difference in the balance is zero, the universe will neither crunch nor expand. Measured value of dark energy is 120 powers of ten less than its natural value.  If it was 10 119 rather than 10 120  the consequences would be lethal.  If the balance in energy  was slightly more positive, star would explode and human cannot form.</p>

                                                    <p>Steve Hawking writes in his book grand design chapter 'apparent miracle'</p>

                                                    <p>In 1998, observations of very distant supernova (exploding stars) revealed that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, an effect that is not possible without some kind of repulsive force acting thorough out space. Since we now know that its value is non-zero, the question remains that  why does it have the value that it does. Physicist have created argument explaining how it might arise due to quantum mechanical effects, but the value they calculate is about 120 order of magnitude ( a 1 followed by 120 zeros) stronger than the actual value obtained through a supernova observation. That means that either the reasoning employed in the calculations was wrong or else some other effect exists that miraculously cancels all but a unimaginably tiny friction of the number calculated.</p>

                                                    <p>The one thing that is certain is that if the value the cosmological constant were much larger that what it is , our universe will have blown itself apart before galaxies could form – and once again – life as we know it would be impossible.</p>

                                                   <p>About 13 billion years ago, inside gas clouds of Galaxies, homogeneity of matter was again broken. The matter, which was still in the form of Hydrogen or helium, started coalescing to make first generation of huge stars (pop III stars). A natural law appeared for setting of balance and equilibrium in the movements of stars to circulate around their axis and around the centre of galaxies. In the canter of galaxies, quasars with huge black-hole at center were formed, that provided necessary infrastructure to initiate primitive stars.</p>

As cloud of dust and gas collapse under gravity, they start to spin and become hot in the center, finally forming nuclear furnaces, this stage from the start of fusion to the state of equilibrium, is known as a stars main sequence.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>How the Stars End Up</strong><br>Every single star is a hydrogen bomb which ends up in great explosion. On the average, one star explodes in each galaxy per 100 years.  There are trillions of galaxies. So the scientist can possibly see almost every day an explosion somewhere in the sky. A the star reaches its middle age, it slowly uses up its fuel. The core begins to shrink, and the remaining hydrogen burns with a greater luminosity. When the sun expands to a red giant, it will engulf and destroy the inner planets.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Planetary Nebula</strong><br>The dying star sheds its outer layers into space, illuminated by the remnants white dwarf in the centre. The expanding shells of matter recycle the stars bulk back into the galaxy, where it can be recycled to form new stars. Most stars end up as planetary nebulae</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Small Size Stars – To White Dwarf</strong><br>The star ends its life as an incredibly dense mass of carbon and oxygen at a fraction of its original size. Scientists predict that our sun will end up as small as Earth. Now out of fuel, this "white dwarf" will continue to cool. As it solidifies into pure carbon, white dwarf crystallizes into largest diamond in the universe.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Medium Size Stars - To Neutron Stars</strong><br>The collapsed emanates of the stars core, a neutron stars is the smallest star and one of the densest known object in the universe, with the mass of the Sun squeezed into the mass of a city. Compressing all the humanity into a sugar cube would yield the same density as the neutron star, some of which spin hundreds of times per second</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Massive Size Stars - To Black holes</strong><br>When massive star explode, Black Holes is born. The densest object in the universe, with gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. At the centre is the 'singularity', where the mass of the dead star is compressed to a single point of almost zero size and infinite density.</p>

                                                   <p>Massive stars bigger than 400-800 suns are natural furnaces to cook elements used in the formation of earth like planets</p>

                                                   <p>Our sun, with diameter of 1,392,000 km is small sun with an active life span of 10 billion years.  Bigger the star, more hydrogen burn to maintain the large size, shorts the life such as less than one billion years.  Hydrogen converts into helium. Helium is heavy so it stay at core. Hydrogen ends, Helium starts burning producing carbon, nitrogen then oxygen until iron which have atomic number 27.  Our sun, which is relatively small in size, will burn up until carbon.  Note: Our earth diameter is just 12,756 km</p>

                                                   <p><strong>وَلِلَّـهِ غَيْبُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَمَا أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلَّا كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّـهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong><br>[16:77] And to Allah belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And the command for the Hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>سَابِقُوا إِلَىٰ مَغْفِرَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَجَنَّةٍ عَرْضُهَا كَعَرْضِ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أُعِدَّتْ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّـهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّـهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّـهُ ذُو الْفَضْلِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong><br>[57:21] Race toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth, prepared for those who believed in Allah and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah which He gives to whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.</p>

                                                   <p><strong>وَاللَّـهُ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ بِسَاطًا </strong>   [71:19] And Allah has made for you the earth an expanse</p>

Elements started accumulating In the whirlpool of solar system.<br>Sun ignited, most of the gases in the whirlpool around sun were repelled to outer layers of the whirlpool to make Jupiter and other planets. Heavier particles remained near the sun to accumulate and make the hard planets. Earth was made at an appropriate distance from the sun. The 93 million mile distance from the sun is called 'goldilocks zone', where water can remain liquid.</p>
