(Purity of thought, mind and intellect is a prerequisite for drawing benefit from it. If a person studies it with a prejudiced mind or is influenced by preconceived ideas or preferences, then he will not derive any benefit from it. It is therefore important that before a person undertakes its study, his mind should be clear of any preconceived ideas.)</p>

Back in 1650, the pendulum of research & technology shifted to the west and the downfall of Muslims started. Media of press united all intellectuals. Galileo, Newton and Copernicus started looking the work and working of Allah. Imam Ghazali, since 1200 already closed the door for Muslims scientist to emerge. Due to power of media, the pope could not stop developments in Europe.  As a result, Osmania Empire's , still living under the glory of past, completed its downfall after World War 1.</p>
                                                        <p>Religion could not stem the downfall due to;<br>
                                                        1. Religions are too steeped with past glories and provide bleak future for the people of this world.<br>
                                                        2. Muslims leaders found vested interest in keeping eyes at back, Keep DEEN as museum dogma to limit access of contemporary minds.<br>
                                                        3. By writing Tafaseer's at particular knowledge & wisdom level, medieval Muslim scholars unknowingly hobbled Quran with monopolistic understanding. As a result, hooked up thinking decreased the ability of Quran to address future issues.</p>

                                                        <p>Educated Pondering Muslims, due to lack of understanding the relevance, felt disconnected from Quran. Many took Islam, as private religion that ends at rituals and play no role in worldly life. Many migrated to the developed societies made by secular people around the world</p>

Religion leadership comes with showering flowers to support such events. But these efforts cannot stop the downfall of Muslims. The events are mostly as 'look busy give no take away'.</p>

Allah never come at a place cluttered with human-made gods. Many myths may exist in Islam. Once Allah comes in, all those myths get exposed and vanish.</p>

                                                        <p>An authenticity crisis is a serious issue. The advanced knowledge is exposing non-authentic content in religion in sects. Lack of research discipline in religion is making it stagnant and non-relevant to the contemporary world. Living in the History snatches vision of the future. Self-obsolescence leads to irrelevance and elimination.</p>

                                                        <p>EXAMPLE: Almost 97% of Muslims have non-Quranic concept of Allah. Allah physically moves from Sky seven to Sky one at night. At space station 500 km above the ground, there is no night, as we know?</p>

                                                        <p>For a Muslim to go against Quran is dishonest thinking? Still many Muslims commit sins and heinous crimes with the promise to eventually settle in Jennet with prophets. Where as Quran give concept of scale and say:</p>

                                                        <p><strong>Power of Role Model:</strong>  Looking at the power of role model; 18 years after Higree, two super power vanished from history just to to be replaced with exploitation free system of living Through Kahlifa Hazrat Omar. Persian Empire vanished altogether and Roman Empire shrunk to insignificance. Muslim KHILAFAT emerged that existed as super power until 1650. Principles from the Prophet saw model always provide success.</p>

                                                        <p>1 – Mohammad PBUH 40 years clean and ameen life, pre-prophet hood, with no black spot.<br>

                                                        3 – Quran documents complete Role Model, which must be read for actual learning and not just be recited for swab earning<br>
                                                        4 - USWA E HUSNA is sect free with secular justice. To be in a sect is shirk and sin. Future is 'AQLE SALEEM' the individual pondering and no more following of any other human. Learn from others but validate from Quran. It was the way of Prophet Ibrahim AS and it is the way of our beloved prophet Mohammad PBUH.</p>
